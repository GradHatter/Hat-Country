# Hat-Country
I took a picture of one of my baseball hats (Superman) and extracted the outline using OpenCV

Then compareison.py imports the outline and compares it to the outline of every country in the world

The end result is:

Ghana is the most hat-like country with a similarity of 88.63%
Solomon Is. is the least hat-like country with a similarity of 28.02%
